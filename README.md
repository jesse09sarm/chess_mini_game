This game can be used to enhance a chess player's knowledge of pawn movements and their power when used together. 
The game follows standard chess rules but only consists of a row of pawns against a queen.
All pieces are in their usual starting positions with the pawns having the first move.
The goal is to capture all the pawns before they reach the 8th rank (highest row on the board).
Moves are made by the user clicking a piece then clicking the new desired square.

The game ends when a pawn reaches the 8th rank, all pawns are captured, the queen is captured, or the user exits the window.
